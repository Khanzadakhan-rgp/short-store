            <h2> The Greedy Dog </h2>
            <p>There once lived a dog in a village. He was always hungry and looking for food. The dog was also very greedy and was never satisfied with what he had or got. The dog kept wandering everywhere, searching for food, and could never get content. Each time the dog got food, he would promise himself that he would be happy with what he had and not crave it anymore. But within a few seconds, he would forget the promise and try to look for more food or grab it from another animal.One day he was wandering and searching for food as usual. A river flowed by his house and a bridge was there to help everyone cross to the other side. He decided to cross the bridge by his house and look for food on the other side. He looked all around but could not find anything. Suddenly, he spotted a bone lying outside a small hut. The bone was big and juicy, and he ran to grab it, and held it tightly in his mouth. He thought he would cross the bridge and eat it at leisure at home. He was afraid that if any of his friends or other animals spotted the bone, they would also want a share of it. He wanted to devour it all by himself.As he was crossing the bridge to go home, he saw another dog holding a bone in its mouth. He noticed that the bone looked as juicy and big as the one he had. He began to think about how lucky he would be if he got that bone to eat too. He started thinking of ways to get the other bone from the dog in the river. He barked at the dog, assuming the other dog would immediately throw the bone. The moment he barked, the bone in his mouth fell into the water. He also fell into the water in surprise, and flowed away, till he was able to get onto dry land. He then realised that the dog he saw was not another dog but his own reflection. He regretted his action and realised it was a big mistake to be greedy. He had to return home without a bone and nothing to eat. He realised he had paid a heavy price for his greed. He learned his lesson and promised himself he would no longer be greedy.</p>
            <p>Moral Of The Story</p>
              <p>The moral of the story is “We should not be greedy”. Greed is a curse and will make us do things that are not the right choices. Greed makes us selfish, short-tempered, anxious, and also jealous of others. It is foolish to be greedy in life. One must be content with what one has and not tempted by the possession of others. Greed stops us from welcoming challenges and gifts with courage and wisdom. Greed shrouds our minds and blocks us from seeing the actual value of things. It is wrong to be tempted by the possession of others and seek it. We must work hard to earn what we want and be satisfied with what we have.</p>

            <h2> The Thirsty Crow  </h2>
            <p>It was a sweltering day with the sun overhead when birds and animals could find very little to drink to quench their thirst. Among them was a thirsty crow who searched for water all over the fields. He looked everywhere, but there was not a drop to drink.He felt weak and sad and thought to himself, “Caw, caw, caw. I have been searching for water since the morning, but there is not a drop in sight!” “The thirst is making me dizzy.”

              Just as the crow was glooming, he suddenly saw a water pitcher. “Thank goodness! I hope there is some water in that little pitcher.”He flew straight down to that pitcher to see if water was left in it. And to his surprise, there was some water in the pitcher.

              As the crow pushed his head into the pitcher, it could not go deeper. “Oh no. I could not get to the water.” The pitcher was high with a narrow neck, and the water level was too low. He tried pushing the pitcher to a side for the water to flow out. “If I tilt this pitcher, maybe the water would come out, and I will easily drink it.” But the pitcher was very heavy to tilt.The crow did not lose hope. He looked around and started thinking of a way to get water out of the pitcher. Then, an idea struck him! He saw some pebbles on the ground. The crow started collecting pebbles one by one and dropped them into the pitcher. As more and more pebbles went into the pitcher, the water rose up. Soon enough, the water came to a level through which the crow could drink water. He drank the water happily and thanked mother nature.

            </p>
            <p>Moral Of The Story</p>
             <p> “Where there is a will, there is a way!”</p>
              
             <p>By reading this short story, the moral we learn is that by thinking and working hard, we may find the solution to any difficult problem. If we have willingness and determination, anything can be achieved. The crow used his patience and intelligence to put stones into the pitcher so water could get out. He did not lose hope, and with persistence (dropping pebbles one by one), he drank water and saved his life.
              
              We must teach children that in any adverse situation, the most important thing is to keep patience, observe the situation, and then find a solution with the available resources.</p>

            <h2>The Hare And The Tortoise</h2>
            <p>One day a Hare was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing on the turtle for being so slow.
    
              After seeing the overconfidence turtle challenged him to a race. Hare(Rabbit) laughed at turtle’s challenge and he accepted the challenge.As the race started, the hare ran very fast and went far ahead from the turtle and got tired.

              He thought there was plenty of time to relax as the turtle was very far behind. Soon he falls asleep thinking he would win the race easily.
              
              
              Meanwhile, turtle(tortoise) continue to walk slowly, until he reaches the finish line. The overslept hare sees the turtle on the other side of the finish line. The turtle had beaten him in the race.</p>

            <p>Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

            <h2>The Ugly Duckling</h2>
          <p>A long time ago, a farmer had a duck, which laid 4 eggs. After a few days, all eggs hatched.

            Three ducklings looked like their mom and the fourth one looked different. It was big and grey.
            
            All other ducklings started making fun of him, as they started calling him ugly.
            
            After some days the sad duckling ran away to a river nearby. There he saw a beautiful white swans.

After seeing their beauty he wanted to drown in the river. But when he looked at his reflection in the river, he realized he was not an ugly duckling but a beautiful Swan! </p>
       
<p>Moral: You are beautiful just the way you are.</p>

         <p>Once on a bright summer’s sunny day, a Grasshopper was singing then he saw an Ant working hard to collect food, the grasshopper said, “Why do you work so hard in summers? Summers are for fun, relaxation and enjoyment. Come let us sing and enjoy”.But Ant said, “I am collecting food for the winters and I recommend you to do the same.”

          Grasshopper said, “We have got plenty of food at present. Why bother about winter now?”.
          
          The Ant ignored him and went on its way.
          
          When the winter came grasshopper had no food to eat.
          
          He saw that Ant and begged for food, but she said, “When I worked hard, you enjoyed”.
          
          Then grasshopper learned his lesson the hard way.</p>

All animals went to him to tell, that daily one of them will come to him for his meal.So, the Lion agreed and this started going for many days. One day, it was Rabbit’s turn. When he was on his way he saw a well.

          Now he plans to kill the lion and save himself. He went to the lion and told him that, there is another lion who claims to be more powerful than him.
          
          Then the lion asks the rabbit to take him to that lion. The rabbit takes him to the well and said he lives here. When the lion looked in the well he saw his own reflection and jumped in the well and dies.</p>

    <p>Once a cap seller was going to sell his caps in a village market. He was going through the forest and was carrying a basket of red caps on his head.

      He got tired in the heat of the sun and thought of lying down under the tree for some time. He put his basket on the ground and fall asleep.

      There were monkeys on that tree, they came down and one by one took all the caps from the cap seller’s basket. Then they climbed onto the tree.

      When the cap seller woke up, he was shocked to see his basket empty. He searched for his caps everywhere. To his surprise, he saw the monkeys were wearing them.
      
      He thought for a while and he started throwing his cap down and monkeys did so.The cap-seller collected all his caps and put them back in his basket and went away happily.</p>
      <p>Moral: We should deal with wisdom in tough situations because wisdom helps during difficult times.</p>
